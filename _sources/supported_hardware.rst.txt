Data Acquisition Card
----------------------------
NI
^^^^^^^^^^
We have used several different NI-based data acquisition cards to run the software.
These include PCIe-6738, PXIe-6259, and PXIe-6733. Prior to installing the card within the computer, first install
the `NI-DAQmx drivers <https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html#464560>`_. Once installed,
connect the PCIe or PXIe-based device to the computer. A functioning system should be recognized by the operating system,
and visible in the Windows Device Manager as a **NI Data Acquisition Device**.

.. tip::

    To find the device pin outs for your NI-based data acquisition card, open up NI MAX, find the card under devices,
    right-click and select 'device pin outs'.

    Important: Should you use the SCB-68A breakout box, do not look at the pinout on the back of the cover.
    This is misleading. You must look at the device pinouts in NI MAX.

The most important aspect is to wire up the triggering properly. The software first calculates all of the analog and digital waveforms, creates the NI tasks, and then queues these waveforms on the data acquisition board.
Upon receipt of a trigger, all of the analog an digital tasks are delivered in parallel. This provides us with deterministic behavior on a per-frame basis, which is necessary for proper ASLM-style acquisitions. It does not
however provide us with deterministic behavior between image frames, and some jitter in timing is anticipated.

Wiring
- Identify the device name in NI MAX, and change it if you would like. Common names are ``Dev1``, ``Dev2``, etc. This name must correspond with the pinouts provided in the configuration file.

- Connect the ``master_trigger_out_line`` to the ``trigger_source`` with a direct wire, commonly ``PXI6259/port0/line1`` and ``/PXI6259/PFI0``

.. note::

    For NI-based cards, port0/line1 is the equivalent of ``P0.1``.
    There are multiple pins for each PFIO, including source, out, gate, etc. You must use the out terminal.

PCIe-6738
"""""""""
The PCIe-6738 can only create one software-timed analog task for every four channels.
As such, the lasers much be attached to analog output ports outside of the banks used by
the galvo/remote focus units. For example, if you use AO0, AO2, and AO6 for the
remote focus, galvo, and galvo stage, the lasers should be connected to AO8, AO9, and
AO10. In such a configuration, they will not compete with the other AO ports. Since
only one task will be created created on the AO8, AO9, AO10 bank at a time (only
one laser is on at a time), only one laser can be on at a time. If we wanted to turn
lasers on simultaneously, we could distribute the lasers across independent banks (e
.g. AO8, AO14, AO19).


PXI-6259
"""""""""
The PXI-6259 can create one software-timed analog task per channel. As such, the
galvo/remote focus/lasers can be attached to any of the analog output ports.

PXI-6723
""""""""""
- Connect the ``master_trigger_out_line`` to the ``trigger_source`` with a direct wire, commonly ``PXI6723/port0/line1`` and ``/PXI6723/PFI0``. With an SCB-68A breakout box, connect pin 17 directly to pin 11.
- Connect the ``camera_trigger_out_line`` to the ``Ext. Trigger`` on the camera using the ``CTR0Out`` pin. With an SCB-68A breakout box, the positive lead is pin 2, the ground is pin 36.

Hamamatsu Flash 4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Insert the USB that came with the camera into the computer and install HCImageLive.
* When prompted with the DCAM-API Setup

    * Install the Active Silicon Firebird drivers for the FrameGrabber
    * Select ... next to the tools button, and install DCAM tools onto the computer.

* Shutdown the computer and install the Hamamatsu frame grabber into an appropriate PCIe-x16 slot on the motherboard.
* Turn on the computer and the camera, and confirm that it is functioning properly in HCImageLive or Excap (one of the DCAM tools installed)
* Connect the `camera_trigger_out_line` to the External Trigger of the Hamamatsu Camera. Commonly, this is done with a
counter port, e.g., ``/PXI6259/ctr0``

Remote Focusing Devices
-------------------------
Voice coils, also known as linear actuators, play a crucial role in implementing
aberration-free remote focusing in ASLM. These electromagnetic actuators are used to
control the axial position of the light-sheet and the sample relative to the
microscope objective lens. By precisely adjusting the axial position, the focal plane
can be shifted without moving the objective lens, thus enabling remote focusing.

Equipment Solutions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configuration can be variable. Many of the voice coils we have received require establishing serial
communication with the device to explicitly place it in an analog control mode. More recently, Equipment
Solutions has begun delivering devices that automatically initialize into an analog control mode, and thus
no longer need the serial communication to be established.

Stages
------------------------
Our software empowers users with a flexible solution for configuring
multiple stages, catering to diverse microscope modalities. Each stage can be
customized to suit the specific requirements of a particular modality or shared
across  various modalities. Our unique approach allows seamless integration of stages
from different manufacturers, enabling users to mix and match components for a truly
versatile and optimized setup tailored to their research needs.

ASI Tiger Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Constant Velocity Acquisition - Software is designed to acquire data in a continuous
stage scanning mode. Rather than using the default SYNC signal from the ASI stage to
synchronize the start of imaging, we use the encoder output pulsing mode of the ASI
stage to trigger the acquisition of every frame at precise intervals.  Important for
multi-channel imaging that is acquired in the per-stack mode, but less so for
perZ-based acquisitions.

.. tip::
    If you are using the FTP-2000 stage, you should not change the F stage axis. This will
    differentially drive the two vertical posts, causing them to torque and potentially damage
    one another.
