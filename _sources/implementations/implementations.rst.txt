Implemented Microscopes
===========================================

As an example of the flexibility of the **navigate** software, we describe several
microscope implementations that are currently in use with the software. Each of these
implementations is described in the following sections, including a list of the equipment
used and the configuration file used to operate the microscope. While this list does not
aim to be comprehensive, it does show the diversity of microscopes that can be controlled
using the **navigate** software. For example, this includes single and multi-camera systems,
microscopes with different illumination and detection schemes, and microscopes with different
sample geometries and scan mechanisms.

For more information on how to build these microscopes, as well as their performance,
please refer to the publications listed in the relevant sections.

(Bottom) images of the live-cell ASLM implementation.*

Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscope (ASLM) is designed specifically to achieve
high-resolution imaging throughout large fields of view. This custom-built system offers unparalleled resolution
of 300-380 nm isotropically across extensive imaging volumes measuring up to
200x200x200 microns, employing one-photon excitation techniques.

The ASLM system features a Special Optics 28.5X/NA 0.67 illumination objective
and a Nikon 25X/NA 1.1 detection objective. It is equipped with a diverse array of
laser wavelengths including 445, 488, 514, 561, and 642 nm, enabling versatile multicolor
imaging capabilities. The system leverages aberration-free remote focusing to scan the
illumination beam in sync with the rolling shutters of two Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 sCMOS cameras.
Because ASLM does not depend upon diffractive optics, such as spatial light modulators,
it is capable of simultaneous multicolor imaging.

Unique to ASLM, the system maintains diffraction-limited and isotropic resolution over
arbitrarily large volumes. The resulting point spread function (PSF) is isotropic,
devoid of side lobes or significant blurring,  obviating the need for deconvolution.
Moreover, ASLM achieves significantly higher illumination uniformity compared to
traditional Gaussian or Bessel beam approaches. This uniformity translates to a
consistent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) throughout the imaging volume, greatly enhancing
quantitative imaging applications such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and
single particle tracking. This combination of features makes ASLM an exceptional tool
for detailed, quantitative imaging across large sample volumes.

Optical Tiling OPM
******************

*(Left) Image of a monolayer of keratinoctyes imaged with the Optical Tiling OPM.

(Right, top and bottom) Images of the Optical Tiling OPM system.*

The Oblique Plane Microscope (OPM) described here is engineered for high-resolution, fast volumetric imaging of large fluorescent
samples, such as cell monolayers, spheroids, and zebrafish embryos. This system
addresses the common challenge of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution throughout a large field of view,
which is often restricted in OPM setups due to optics associated with the tertiary imaging system.

To overcome these constraints, the microscope incorporates a novel dual-axis scan unit,
enabling rapid, high-resolution imaging across a volume of 800 × 500 × 200 microns.
Furthermore, the system integrates a multi-perspective projection imaging technique, which
significantly enhances the volumetric interrogation rate to over 10 Hz.
This feature facilitates quick scanning across a large field of view in a dimensionally reduced format,
allowing for the swift identification and detailed imaging of specific regions of interest.

The custom-built oblique plane microscope is built in an inverted geometry.
Illumination is provided obliquely at a 40-degree angle using an Olympus 20X/NA 1.05 water
immersion objective, and fluorescence is captured in an epi-fluorescence format by the same objective.
The fluorescence signal is then relayed through an Olympus 20x/NA 0.8 secondary objective
and redirected by a custom glass-tipped tertiary objective set at a 40-degree angle.
Images are captured using a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera. Multi-well plate plate imaging
is available through mechanical sample scanning.

AO OPM

   :width: 100%
   :align: center

*(Left) Images of zebrafish vasculature before and after application of sensorless adaptive optics.
(Right) image of the OPM equipped with adaptive optics.*

Adaptive optics (AO) significantly enhances the performance of microscopes
by restoring diffraction-limited imaging capabilities, particularly beneficial in
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) where optical aberrations can vary significantly
between the illumination and detection paths. To overcome these challenges,
this oblique plane microscope includes a singular deformable mirror that effectively corrects
aberrations in both the illumination and detection paths simultaneously.
Aberrations are measured in a sensorless format on projection images, which stabilizes and refines
wavefront corrections.

The custom-built OPM is optimized for zebrafish studies and incorporates a VAST BioImager Platform
that automates zebrafish loading and positioning. Illumination is provided obliquely at 40 degrees using a
Nikon 25X/NA 1.1 water immersion objective, and the collected fluorescence is processed using the same
objective in an epi-fluorescence format. The signal is then relayed through an Olympus 20x/NA 0.8 secondary
objective, directed by a custom glass-tipped tertiary objective at a 40-degree angle, and
finally captured on a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera.

*(Left) Image of an expanded liver section imaged with the Expansion ASLM. (Right) Image of
the Expansion ASLM system.*

This upright variant of Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscopy (ASLM) boasts a field of
view that is 3.2 times larger than its predecessors, measuring 774 x 435 microns with a
raw and isotropic resolution of approximately 420 nm. The upright sample geometry is
advantageous for imaging fragile, expanded tissues, as well as samples that have large
lateral extents. The system is equipped with an
Omicron LightHub Ultra laser launch that features multiple fiber outputs and provides
emission wavelengths at 405, 488, 561, and 642 nm. The microscope utilizes a
high-sensitivity back-thinned Hamamatsu Lightning sCMOS camera and includes a fast filter wheel.
Imaging is performed with 0.7 NA multi-immersion objectives and a FTP-2000 motorized
stage from Applied Scientific Instrumentation. The microscope supports multiple imaging
modes to accommodate different research needs.
These include the classical step-and-settle routine, where the stage moves between
image acquisitions. For large samples, the stage can operate at a constant velocity,
with images captured at predetermined intervals, minimizing the latency typically
associated with the step-and-settle method and improving throughput. Lastly, the
microscope can operate in a mechanically sheared acquisition format, where two stages
are scanned simultaneously. This  approach aligns data automatically in its correct
spatial context, significantly reducing the need for computational post-processing and
eliminating data interpolation and duplication.

MCT-ASLM

*(Top) Two different perspectives of the multiscale cleared tissue Axially Swept Light-Sheet
Microscope (MCT-ASLM). (Bottom) A mouse lung imaged at 1x, 6x, and 37x magnification.
Automatic event-driven switching between the low-resolution and high-resolution modes.
Scale bars, 50 microns.*

The Multiscale Cleared Tissue Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscope (MCT-ASLM) is a
sophisticated imaging system designed to investigate rare processes within large,
chemically cleared multicellular samples. This advanced microscope incorporates dual
imaging systems, termed the macroscale and nanoscale modules, which are uniquely aligned
in a 4-axis geometry to optimize observation and analysis.

The macroscale module utilizes a single-sided illumination technique adapted from
mesoSPIM, featuring a modified Nikon AF-S 50mm camera lens that projects light in
a digitally scanned light-sheet format. This design minimizes shadows and enhances
image clarity. Illumination control is achieved through an electro-tunable lens that
synchronizes the laser beam's movement with the rolling shutter of a CMOS camera,
specifically a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 V3. This setup allows for low numerical aperture
axial light-sheet microscopy (ASLM) and supports variable magnification via an Olympus
MVX-10 macro microscope for effective detection.

In contrast, the nanoscale module is designed for high-resolution imaging with a
numerical aperture (NA) of 0.7 and uses multi-immersion objectives suitable for
various solvents with refractive indices between 1.33 and 1.56. These objectives
are engineered to be free from spherical and chromatic aberrations, and they maintain
a significant working distance of 10mm. Aberration-free focusing is managed by a
voice coil, and shadow reduction is enhanced with a resonant galvanometer that provides
multidirectional illumination.

Central to its operation, the specimen is precisely positioned at the intersection of
both imaging modules using high-precision translation and rotation stages that offer
extensive travel distances (approximately 50-200 mm). This configuration enables rapid
switching between macroscale and nanoscale imaging modes. The MCT-ASLM is adept at
quickly producing detailed scans of large cleared tissues (up to 20 x 20 x 20 mm in size)
at a resolution of 5 microns. Furthermore, it integrates advanced computer vision techniques
to automatically identify biological features of interest and allows for detailed
analysis with isotropic resolution up to 300 nm. A publication describing the MCT-ASLM
system is currently in preparation.

*A CAD image of the single sided variant of the benchtop mesoSPIM equipped with a Meca500
robotic arm and a Thorlabs rotary stage for automatic sample loading and unloading.*

This single-sided illumination benchtop mesoSPIM features an Oxxius L4Cc laser launch
equipped with 488, 561, and 638 nm lasers, Applied Scientific Instrumentation stages for
positioning in X, Y, Z, Theta, and Focus. The microscope uses an
XLFLUOR4X/340 NA 0.28 illumination objective, which is well-suited for larger field views
and deeper penetration into the samples. Imaging is performed with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0
camera and an 8-position emission filter wheel. A galvanometer provides digitally
scanned illumination and an electrotunable lens facilitates scanning of the illumination
beam along its propagation direction, enabling Axially Swept Light-Sheet Imaging. Additionally,
the setup includes a Meca500 robotic arm, which automates the loading and unloading of
samples, significantly enhancing experimental throughput. A publication describing the
robotic mesoSPIM system is currently in preparation.

BioFrontiers OPM
****************

The BioFrontiers Institute, a designated Beckman Center for Advanced Light-Sheet Microscopy and Data Science,
is developing an Oblique Plane Microscopy (OPM) system. This system features a high
numerical aperture (NA) water dipping objective specifically designed for cutting-edge
research on stem cell-derived organoids and live imaging of mammalian embryonic neural tube closure.
Stem cell-derived organoids are increasingly recognized as superior in vitro models of
human organ development and disease. They offer significant potential in the realms of
drug discovery and tissue repair, owing to their ability to mimic the complex
architecture and functionality of human tissues. These organoids are produced
through self-organization processes that replicate the intricate structural and
functional characteristics of natural organs, making them invaluable in medical and biological research.
Additionally, the OPM system will be instrumental in studying neural tube development—an
embryonic structure that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord.
Understanding the mechanisms of neural tube closure is crucial, as its failure leads to
neural tube defects such as spina bifida.
