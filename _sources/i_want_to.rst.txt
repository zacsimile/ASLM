This section contains how-to documents organized into three levels of difficulty: 
beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

- The beginner how-to is intended for users who have little to no experience with
  computer programming and simply wish to acquire an image.

- The intermediate how-to is intended for users who want to learn how to use the 
  graphical user interface to create their own smart acquisition workflows.

- The advanced how-to is intended for users who have experience with computer
  programming and wish to extend the functionality of **navigate** by adding new 
  devices or writing their own acquisition features.

Through this tiered approach, we hope to provide a gentle introduction to the software
while also reaching the maximum number of users.
