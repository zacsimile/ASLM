This section contains a collection of tutorials that are organized by topic and provide
step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish a specific task.  The tutorials are
organized into three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

- The beginner tutorials are intended for users who have little to no experience with
  computer programming and simply wish to acquire an image.

- The intermediate tutorials are intended for users who want to learn how to use the graphical user interface to
  create their own smart acquisition workflows.

- The advanced tutorials are intended for users who have experience with computer
  programming and wish to extend the functionality of **navigate** by adding new devices or
  writing their own plugins.

Through this tiered approach, we hope to provide a gentle introduction to the software
while also reaching the maximum number of users.
