Software Installation
*********************

Download Git
------------
If you do not have `Git already installed <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, you will need to do so before downloading the repo.
We also recommend installing `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ for a more user-friendly experience.


Setup your Python Environment
-----------------------------
Head over to the `miniconda website <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links>`_
and install the appropriate version based on your operating system.

.. tip::

    It is also handy to have the `conda cheatsheet <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf>`_ open when first using miniconda to get accustomed to the commands available.



* Windows: Search your computer for the anaconda prompt window. Given how frequently you will use this, we recommend pinning it to your taskbar.
* Linux/Mac: Search your computer for Terminal.

**Create a python environment called ASLM with Python version 3.9.7**::

    (base) MyComputer ~ $ conda create -n ASLM python=3.9.7

.. note::
    If you are inside of a firewall, e.g., on the UTSW campus, you will likely run into a proxy error.
    See the Troubleshooting section below for information on how to add the proxy address to your environment variables to circumvent this problem.


**Activate the ASLM environment**::

    (base) MyComputer ~ $ conda activate ASLM

The active environment is shown in parentheses on the far-left.  Originally, we were in the miniconda base environment.
After activatin the ASLM environment, it should now show (ASLM).

**Update the pip python package manager**::

    (ASLM) MyComputer ~ $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip


**Create a directory where the repository will be cloned**
    We recommend a path/location that is easy to find and access such as the your Desktop or Documents.
    Once the folder is created, we will want to change that to our working directory (e.g., cd)

* Windows::

    (ASLM) C:\Users\Dean-Lab cd Desktop
    (ASLM) C:\Users\Dean-Lab\Desktop mkdir Code
    (ASLM) C:\users\Dean-Lab\Desktop cd Code

* Linux/Mac::

    (ASLM) MyComputer ~ $ mkdir ~/Desktop/Code
    (ASLM) MyComputer ~ $ cd ~/Desktop/Code

**Clone the GitHub repository**::

    (ASLM) MyComputer MyFolderName $ git clone https://github.com/TheDeanLab/ASLM.git

**Install the ASLM repository**

The last step requires you to change into the ASLM directory and the install the repo as a package locally on your machine.::

    (ASLM) MyComputer MyFolderName $ cd ASLM
    (ASLM) MyComputer ASLM $ pip install -e .


**Run the ASLM software**::
    (ASLM) MyComputer ASLM $ aslm

.. note::

    If you are running the software on a computer that does not have the appropriate hardware you will need to add the flag -sh after aslm:

        aslm -sh


After completeting these steps you will only need to do the below to start the software upon opening the prompt:

.. code-block::

    (base) MyComputer ~ $ conda activate ASLM
    (ASLM) MyComputer ~ $ aslm

.. note::

    If you are running Windows, you can create a desktop shortcut to ASLM by right-clicking the Desktop, navigating to New and then Shortcut and entering ``%windir%\system32\cmd.exe "/c" C:\path\to\miniconda\Scripts\activate.bat aslm && aslm`` into the location text box.

GPU Dependencies
----------------
Some of the software routines for microscope feedback are accelerated using GPU computing.
These require a CUDA GPU device that is compatible with TensorFlow (1.15), PyTorch (1.10.2), CuPy, ...
`Excellent directions can be found for CuPy <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html>`_.
    * `NVIDIA CUDA Version 11.2 <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.2.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exelocal>`_
    * `cuDNN SDK 8.4.1 <https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download>`_
    * NVIDIA Graphics Driver >450.80.02
    * TensorRT 7
    * Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019

Troubleshooting
---------------

If running the software on campus at UTSW you may need to update some of your proxy settings to allow pip/conda to install the proper packages.
    * This can be done by going to Environment Variables for Windows, or another OS equivalent.
    * Create the following new System Variables:
        *  Variable = HTTP_PROXY; Value = http://proxy.swmed.edu:3128
        *  Variable = HTTPS_PROXY; Value = http://proxy.swmed.edu:3128 (please see that they are both http, this is purposeful and not a typo)
    * If you continue to have issues then change the value of Variable HTTPS_PROXY to https://proxy.swmed.edu:3128
    * If you still have issues then you will need to create/update both configuration files for conda and pip to include proxy settings, if they are not in the paths below you will need to create them. This assumes a Windows perspective. Mac/Linux users will have different paths, they can be found online.
        *  Conda's Config file = C:\Users\UserProfile\.condarc
        *  Pip's Config file = C:\Users\UserProfile\pip\pip.ini
    * You can also try to set the proxy from within the Anaconda Prompt:
	  *  set https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
	  *  set http_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
