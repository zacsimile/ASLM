Data Acquisition Card
=====================

Data acquisition cards control analog and digital inputs and outputs. The software
uses them for hardware-timed control of voice coil and galvo mirror sweeping synced
with camera acquisition and, optionally, stage movements.

NI
--

We have used several different NI-based data acquisition cards to run the software.
These include PCIe-6738, PXIe-6259, and PXIe-6733. Prior to installing the card within
the computer, first install the `NI-DAQmx drivers <https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html#464560>`_.
Once installed, connect the PCIe or PXIe-based device to the computer. A functioning
system should be recognized by the operating system, and visible in the Windows Device
Manager as a **NI Data Acquisition Device**.

.. tip::

    To find the device pin outs for your NI-based data acquisition card, open up NI
    MAX, find the card under devices, right-click and select "device pin outs".

    Important: Should you use the SCB-68A breakout box, do not look at the pinout on
    the back of the cover. This is misleading. You must look at the device pinouts in
    NI MAX.

The most important aspect is to wire up the triggering properly. The software first
calculates all of the analog and digital waveforms, creates the NI tasks, and then
queues these waveforms on the data acquisition board. Upon receipt of a trigger, all
of the analog an digital tasks are delivered in parallel. This provides us with
deterministic behavior on a per-frame basis, which is necessary for proper ASLM-style
acquisitions. It does not however provide us with deterministic behavior between image
frames, and some jitter in timing is anticipated.

Wiring

- Identify the device name in NI MAX, and change it if you would like. Common names are
  ``Dev1``, ``Dev2``, etc. This name must correspond with the pinouts provided in the
  configuration file.

- Connect the ``master_trigger_out_line`` to the ``trigger_source`` with a direct wire,
  commonly ``PXI6259/port0/line1`` and ``/PXI6259/PFI0``

.. note::

    For NI-based cards, ``port0/line1`` is the equivalent of ``P0.1``.
    There are multiple pins for each PFIO, including source, out, gate, etc. You must
    use the out terminal.

PCIe-6738
^^^^^^^^^

The PCIe-6738 can only create one software-timed analog task for every four channels.
As such, the lasers much be attached to analog output ports outside of the banks used
by the galvo/remote focus units. For example, if you use ao0, ao2, and ao6 for the
remote focus, galvo, and galvo stage, the lasers should be connected to ao8, ao9, and
ao10. In such a configuration, they will not compete with the other analog output
ports. Since only one task will be created created on the ao8, ao9, ao10 bank at a time
(only one laser is on at a time), only one laser can be on at a time. If we wanted to
turn lasers on simultaneously, we could distribute the lasers across independent banks
(e.g. ao8, ao14, ao19).


PXI-6259
^^^^^^^^

The PXI-6259 can create one software-timed analog task per channel. As such, the
galvo/remote focus/lasers can be attached to any of the analog output ports.

PXI-6723
^^^^^^^^

- Connect the ``master_trigger_out_line`` to the ``trigger_source`` with a direct wire,
  commonly ``PXI6723/port0/line1`` and ``/PXI6723/PFI0``. With an SCB-68A breakout box,
  connect pin 17 directly to pin 11.
- Connect the ``camera_trigger_out_line`` to the ``Ext. Trigger`` on the camera using
  the ``CTR0Out`` pin. With an SCB-68A breakout box, the positive lead is pin 2, the
  ground is pin 36.

Cameras
=======

The software supports camera-based acquisition. It can run both normal and rolling
shutter modes of contemporary scientific CMOS cameras.

Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v3/Fusion
-----------------------------

* Insert the USB that came with the camera into the computer and install HCImageLive.
* When prompted with the DCAM-API Setup

    * Install the Active Silicon Firebird drivers for the FrameGrabber
    * Select ... next to the tools button, and install DCAM tools onto the computer.

* Shutdown the computer and install the Hamamatsu frame grabber into an appropriate
  PCIe-x16 slot on the motherboard.
* Turn on the computer and the camera, and confirm that it is functioning properly in
  HCImageLive or Excap (one of the DCAM tools installed)
* Connect the `camera_trigger_out_line` to the External Trigger of the Hamamatsu
  Camera. Commonly, this is done with a counter port, e.g., ``/PXI6259/ctr0``

Remote Focusing Devices
=======================

Voice coils, also known as linear actuators, play a crucial role in implementing
aberration-free remote focusing in navigate. These electromagnetic actuators are used
to control the axial position of the light-sheet and the sample relative to the
microscope objective lens. By precisely adjusting the axial position, the focal plane
can be shifted without moving the objective lens, thus enabling remote focusing.

Equipment Solutions
-------------------

Configuration can be variable. Many of the voice coils we have received require
establishing serial communication with the device to explicitly place it in an analog
control mode. More recently, Equipment Solutions has begun delivering devices that
automatically initialize into an analog control mode, and thus no longer need the
serial communication to be established. However, we often communicate via both
serial and a DAQ port to get this device to run.

Stages
======

Our software empowers users with a flexible solution for configuring
multiple stages, catering to diverse microscope modalities. Each stage can be
customized to suit the specific requirements of a particular modality or shared
across  various modalities. Our unique approach allows seamless integration of stages
from different manufacturers, enabling users to mix and match components for a truly
versatile and optimized setup tailored to their research needs.

ASI Tiger Controller
--------------------

We are set up to communicate with ASI stages via their
`Tiger Controller <https://www.asiimaging.com/controllers/tiger-controller/>`_.

There is a ``feedback_alignment`` configuration option specific to these stages,
which corresponds to the `Tiger Controller AA Command <https://asiimaging.com/docs/commands/aalign>`_.

.. tip::
    If you are using the FTP-2000 stage, you should not change the F stage axis. This
    will differentially drive the two vertical posts, causing them to torque and
    potentially damage one another.

Sutter MP-285
-------------

The `Sutter MP-285 <https://www.sutter.com/MICROMANIPULATION/mp285.html>`_ communicates
via serial port and is quite particular. We have done our best to ensure the
communication is stable, but occasionally the stage will send or receive an extra
character, throwing off communication. In this case, the MP-285's screen will be
covered in 0s, 1s or look garbled. If this happens, simply turn off the software,
power cycle the stage, and press the "MOVE" button on the MP-285 controller once. When
the software is restarted, it should work.

.. tip::

  Sometimes the Coherent Connection software messes with the MP-285 serial
  communication if it is connected to the lasers.

include a special ``hardware`` option, ``refmode``, which corresponds to how the
PI stage chooses to self-reference. Options are ``REF``, ``FRF``, ``MNL``, ``FNL``,
``MPL`` or ``FPL``. These are PI's GCS commands, and the correct reference mode
for your stage should be found by launching PIMikroMove, which should come with
your stage. Stage names (e.g. ``L-509.20DG10``) can also be found in PIMikroMove
or on a label on the side of your stage.

.. _galvo_stage:

Analog-Controlled Galvo/Piezo
-----------------------------

We sometimes control position via a galvo or piezo with no software API.
In this case, we treat a standard galvo mirror or piezo as a stage axis. We control the
"stage" via voltages sent to the galvo or piezo. The ``volts_per_micron`` setting
allows the user to pass an equation that converts position in microns ``x``, which is
passed from the software stage controls, to a voltage. Note that we use
``GalvoNIStage`` whether or not the device is a galvo or a piezo since the logic is
identical.

Galvanometers
=============

Galvo mirrors are used for fast scanning and destriping and occasionally as stages
(see :ref:`Analog-Controlled Galvo/Piezo <galvo_stage>`).

DAQ Control
-----------

Multiple types of galvanometers have been used, including Cambridge
Technologies/Novanta, Thorlabs, and ScannerMAX Each of these devices
are externally controlled via analog signals delivered from a data
acquisition card.

Lasers
======

We currently support laser control via voltage signals.

DAQ Control
-----------

Most lasers are controlled externally via mixed analog and digital modulation.
The ``onoff`` entry is for digital modulation. The ``power`` entry is for analog
modulation.

Shutters
========

Shutters automatically open at the start of acquisition and close upon finish.

Thorlabs
--------

Thorlabs shutters are controlled via a digital on off voltage.

Mechanical Zoom
===============

Zoom devices control the magnification of the microscope. If such control is not
needed, the software expects a :ref:`Synthetic Zoom <synthetic_zoom>` to provide
the fixed magnification and the effective pixel size of the microscope.

Dynamixel Zoom
--------------

This software supports the
`Dynamixel Smart Actuator <https://www.dynamixel.com/>`_.

Configuration File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``positions`` specify the voltage of the actuator at different zoom positions.
The ``stage_positions`` account for focal shifts in between the different zoom values
(the MVXPLAPO does not have a consistent focal plane). These may change depending on
the immersion media. Here it is specified for a ``BABB`` (Benzyl Alcohol Benzyl
Benzoate) immersion media.  The ``pixel_size`` specifies the effective pixel size of
the system at each zoom.

Imagine Optic
-------------

We currently have support for a
`Mirao 52E <https://www.imagine-optic.com/products/deformable-mirror-mirao-52e/>`_.
The ``flat_path`` provides a path to a system correction ``.wcs`` file, an Imagine
Optic proprietary file that stores actuator voltages and corresponding Zernike
coefficients.
