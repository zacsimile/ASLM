Case Study: Imaging on the CT-ASLM-V1 and CT-ASLM-V2
====================================================

This is a case study in using the software to image with a `CT-ASLM-V1 and CT-ASLM-V2 microscopes <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0615-4>`_.

Setting up the chamber
----------------------

Make sure the chamber is clean and dry. If in doubt, fill the chamber with diH2O to see if there are any residues. To clean the chamber, rinse it with diH2O and ethanal, then gently clean the chamber with Q-tips. Repeat the process a few times and end the process with a rinse of 100% ethanal. Gently clean the objectives with lens paper and 100% ethanal. Finally, let the chamber air dry. To speed up the drying process, one can gently blow some air into the chamber.

Once the chamber is completely dry, fill the chamber with imaging media.


Sample loading and finding the samples
--------------------------------------

It's recommended to start the software before loading the sample on the stage.

#. Mount the sample on custom cut glass slide with silicon or super glue.
#. Mount the glass slide onto the sample holder.
#. Mount the sample holder onto the stage with the sample facing the illumination and detection objective so the glass slide is 45 degrees with both objectives.
#. Put down the slit out of the setup.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Camera Settings`. Select “Normal” under :guilabel:`Sensor Mode`.
#. Go to the :guilabel:`Microscope Configuration ‣ Waveform Parameters`. A popup named :guilabel:`Waveform Parameter Settings` will appear.
#. Set the wavelength’s :guilabel:`Amplitude` and :guilabel:`Offset` to 0.0.
#. Select the channel with a proper laser under the :guilabel:`Channels` tab and set the laser power to an appropriate value.
#. Select “Continuous Scan” from the dropdown next to the :guilabel:`Acquire` button. Press :guilabel:`Acquire`. This will launch a live acquisition mode.
#. Scroll around with the stage either via joystick or using the controls in the :guilabel:`Stage Control` tab until the sample comes into view.
#. Focus on the sample in the center of the beam. Zoom in by scrolling the mouse. Slowly adjusting the focus by scrolling the piezo controller to move the detection objective along the z axis. Lower the laser power if the image is saturated.


.. _z_stack_stelzer:

Imaging a Z-Stack with Stelzer mode
-----------------------------------

Stelzer mode is the normal non-ASLM light sheet mode, it gives more signal while offering around 1040 nm (CT-ASLM-V1) and 500 nm (CT-ASLM-V2) lateral resolution.

#. Go to the :guilabel:`Microscope Configuration ‣ Waveform Parameters`. A popup named :guilabel:`Waveform Parameter Settings will appear`.
#. Set the wavelength’s :guilabel:`Amplitude` and :guilabel:`Offset` to 0.0.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Camera Settings`, select “Normal” under :guilabel:`Sensor Mode`.
#. Switch the slit back into the setup.
#. Select the channel with a proper laser under the :guilabel:`Channels` tab and set the laser power to an appropriate value.
#. Select “Continuous Scan” from the dropdown next to the :guilabel:`Acquire` button. Press :guilabel:`Acquire`. This will launch a live acquisition mode.
#. If needed, slowly adjust the slit opening until the image looks uniformly across the whole field of view. Uncheck :guilabel:`Autoscale` in :guilabel:`Camera View` under LUT and adjust the :guilabel:`Min Counts` and :guilabel:`Max Counts` if needed.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Stage Control`, set the Z position in :guilabel:`Stage Positions` to be 0.
#. Find the region of interest by using the joystick or using the controls in the :guilabel:`Stage Control` tab. If using the joystick, hit the big red :guilabel:`STOP` button to update the stage locations to the software.
#. Move along the Z axis with the joystick or the “Focus” in the :guilabel:`Stage Control` tab to one end of the region of interest. If using the joystick, hit the big red :guilabel:`STOP` button to update the stage locations to the software. Under the :guilabel:`Channels` tab, in :guilabel:`Stack Acquistion Settings (um)`, press :guilabel:`Set Start Pos/Foc`.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Stage Control`, change the Z position in :guilabel:`Stage Positions` to set the scan range. Be aware the range for Z position is 0 - 200. Going outside of the range will cause the stage to have issues.
#. Go back to :guilabel:`Channels` tab, in :guilabel:`Stack Acquistion Settings (um)`, press :guilabel:`Set End Pos/Foc`.
#. Setup :guilabel:`Step Size` under the :guilabel:`Channels`, recommend 3.0 (CT-ASLM-V1) and 1.0 (CT-ASLM-V2).
#. Under the :guilabel:`Channels`, make sure :guilabel:`Enable` is unchecked under :guilabel:`Multi-Position Acquisition`.
#. Under the :guilabel:`Channels`, make sure :guilabel:`Save Data` is checked under :guilabel:`Timepoint Settings`.
#. Select “Z-Stack” from the dropdown next to the :guilabel:`Acquire` button. Press :guilabel:`Acquire`. A popup named :guilabel:`File Saving Dialog` will appear.
#. Fill out the fields and press :guilabel:`Acquire Data`.

.. _z_stack_aslm:

Imaging a Z-Stack with ASLM mode
--------------------------------

ASLM mode is the high-resolution light sheet mode, it gives leas signal but offering around 950 nm (CT-ASLM-V1) and 480 nm (CT-ASLM-V2) isotropic resolution.

#. Switch the slit out of the setup.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Camera Settings`, select “Light-Sheet” under :guilabel:`Sensor Mode`.
#. Select the channel with a proper laser under the :guilabel:`Channels` tab and set the laser power to an appropriate value.
#. Select “Continuous Scan” from the dropdown next to the :guilabel:`Acquire` button. Press :guilabel:`Acquire`. This will launch a live acquisition mode.
#. Go to the :guilabel:`Microscope Configuration ‣ Waveform Parameters`. A popup named :guilabel:`Waveform Parameter Settings` will appear.
