Microscope Implementations
==========================

Below are functioning implementations of the ASLM software.

Multiscale Microscope
------------------------
- Laser source - Omicron LightHUB Ultra. Requires ACC operating mode with analog modulation enabled for 488 nm and 642 nm lasers. 561, which operates separately, requires the mixed modulation mode (Obis).
- Sample Scanning System - L-509.20DG10. Has a unidirectional repeatability of 100 nm, bidirectional repeatablility of 2 microns, and a minimum incremental motion of 100 nm. This is borderline too coarse.
- GPUs - NVIDIA Titan RTX - CUDA Architecture = 7.5, Driver Version = 456.71.
- Camera - 2x Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 with frame grabbers.
- Remote Focusing Units - Optotune Electrotunable Lens for low-resolution imaging and a ThorLabs BLINK for high-resolution imaging.
- National Instruments PXIe-1073 Chassis equipped with PXI6733 and PXI6259 Data Acquisition Devices
- Filter Wheels - 2x 32mm High-Speed Filter Wheels
- Objective Positioner - Mad City Labs Nano F
