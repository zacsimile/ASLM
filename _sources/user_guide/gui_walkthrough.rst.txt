User Interface Walkthrough
==========================

navigate's user interface is modular, and designed to be reconfigurable to a user's
preferences. At a high level, it is split into a menu bar, an acquisition bar, settings
notebooks, and display notebooks.

Menu Bar
========

File
^^^^

.. image:: images/menu_file.png

The :guilabel:`File` menu lets us create, load and save
:ref:`Experiment files <user_guide/software_configuration:experiment file>`,
which store states of the GUI and the hardware. This is useful if you want to perform
an experiment with the same parameters multiple times, but close the software in
between acqusitions.

The :guilabel:`File` menu also provides access to toggle the :guilabel:`Save Data` flag
under :guilabel:`Timepoint Settings` in the Channels Settings Notebook, and to start
an acquisition (which can also be done by pressing :guilabel:`Acquire` in the
:ref:`user_guide/gui_walkthrough:acquisition bar`). Loading and unloading images only
works if we have a
:ref:`synthetic camera <user_guide/hardware/supported_hardware:synthetic camera>`. In
this case, it loads images to display in lieu of the simulated noise generated by the
synthetic camera.

:guilabel:`Open Log Files` opens the folder containing the software's log files. This
is helpful for debugging code and configuration problems.

:guilabel:`Open Configuration Files` opens the folder containing the software's
:ref:`configuration file <user_guide/software_configuration:configuration file>`.

Acquisition Bar
===============

Left-to-right, the acquistion bar provides

* An :guilabel:`Acquire` button, which starts acquisition.
* A drop-down menu providing a selection of acquisition modes.
* A progress bar indicating how far through an acquisition we are.
* A time estimate indicatating how much time is left in the acquistion.
* An emergency :guilabel:`Stop Stage` button, which instantly halts all stage movement.
* An :guilabel:`Exit Button`, which quits the software.
