Configuration Overview
======================

This section outlines the ``configuration.yaml``, ``experiment.yml``,
``rest_api_config.yml``, ``waveform_templates.yml``, and
``waveform_constants.yml`` files.

-----------------

.. _configuration_file:
Initial Configuration
=====================
In order for the **navigate** software to function, you will need to configure the
specifications of the various hardware that you will be using in the
``configuration.yaml`` file.

An example ``configuration.yaml`` file is provided in the
``navigate\config`` directory. However, to avoid conflicts between different
microscopes after pulling new changes from GitHub, **navigate** by default
loads a local version of the ``configuration.yaml`` file. This file is
stored in the ``C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\.navigate\config`` directory
on Windows or ``~/.navigate`` on Mac/Linux.

-----------------

Configuration Wizard
-------------------------
To help you set up your configuration file, we have created a configuration wizard
that will guide you through the process of creating your
``configuration.yaml`` file. To launch the configuration wizard, open your
Terminal or Anaconda Prompt, activate your **navigate** Python environment
and launch the software by typing: ``navigate -c``.

   .. image:: images/configurator.PNG
     :width: 400px
     :align: center

The configuration wizard provides a convenient way for configuring your
hardware. For each microscope, which can be renamed or deleted by
right-clicking on the microscope tab, you will be asked to specify the
hardware that you are using. Each hardware type is listed as its own
independent tab, and required parameters are shown on the left column, a
field for the parameter is shown in the middle, and an example of the
parameter is shown on the right.

Additional microscope instances can be added by clicking the
:guilabel:`Add A Microscope` button. Should one want to start from scratch, the
:guilabel:`New Configuration` button will clear the current configuration.
If you have a configuration that you would like to modify, you can load it by
clicking the :guilabel:`Load Configuration` button. Once you have completed
the configuration, you can save it by clicking the :guilabel:`Save` button.
For **navigate** to use the configuration file by default, it should be
saved as ``configuration.yaml`` in the following directory, depending upon
your operating system:

* Windows: ``C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\.navigate\config``
* Mac/Linux: ``~/.navigate``

.. note::

   The configuration wizard is actively being developed, and may not support
   every device type or configuration option. If you encounter any issues
   with the configuration wizard, please let us know by creating an issue on
   `GitHub <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate/issues/new/choose>`_..


-----------------

Manual Configuration
-------------------------
If you prefer to manually configure your ``configuration.yaml`` file, we
recommend launching the software in the synthetic hardware mode initially.
Within your Terminal, or Anaconda Prompt, activate your **navigate**
Python environment and launch the software in the synthetic hardware mode by
typing: ``navigate -sh``.

Upon launching the software in the synthetic hardware mode, **navigate** will
create a copy of the ``navigate\config\configuration.yaml`` file in
``C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\.navigate\config`` on  Windows or ``~/
.navigate`` on Mac/Linux.

Thereafter, you should only modify the ``configuration.yaml`` file in your
local ``.navigate\config`` directory.

.. tip::

    Once **navigate** is open in the synthetic hardware mode, you can open the
    ``configuration.yaml`` file by going to :menuselection:`File` menu and selecting
    :ref:`Open Configuration Files <user_guide/gui_walkthrough:file>`.

It may help to open
``C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\.navigate\config\configuration.yaml`` and follow
along in this file when reading the next sections.

See the :ref:`Setting up an Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscope <setup_aslm>` case
study for a general walkthrough of how to build your own configuration file and see
:doc:`Implementations <implemented_microscopes>` for examples of configuration files.

-----------------

.. _multiple_microscopes:
Microscope Configurations
-------------------------

The ``configuration.yaml`` file contains the microscope configurations
that you will be using with the software. Each microscope is represented as a YAML
dictionary.

Switching between each microscope is readily performed in **navigate**,
enabling you to switch between different configurations or imaging modes,
each with their own unique or shared hardware:

.. code-block:: yaml

    microscopes:
        microscope1:
            ...
            ...
        microscope2:
            ...
            ...

Here, ``microscope1`` and ``microscope2`` are names of two different
microscopes using different combinations of the hardware. The names of
the microscopes must not include spaces or special characters such as ``<``, ``\``,
``#``, ``%``, or ``?``.

Microscope Inheritance
-------------------------
When setting up a ``configuration.yaml`` file with multiple microscopes, the
file can grow quite large and repetitive, especially if the microscopes share
many of the same hardware components. To avoid this, **navigate** allows for
inheritance of hardware components from one microscope to another. In the
following example, ``microscope2`` inherits all of the hardware components
from ``microscope1`` except for the camera, since this is specified in the
``microscope2`` section.

.. code-block:: yaml

    microscopes:
        microscope1:
            camera:
                hardware:
                    type: HamamatsuOrca
                    ...
            ...
        microscope2(microscope1):
            camera:
                hardware:
                    type: HamamatsuFusion
                    ...
            ...


-----------------


Microscope Hardware Specification
---------------------------------

Each microscope is expected to have a ``daq``, ``camera``, ``remote_focus_device``,
``galvo``, ``filter_wheel``, ``stage``, ``zoom``, ``shutter``, ``mirror`` and
``lasers`` section of the YAML dictionary. As in the hardware section, unused devices
can be specified as synthetic.

Most of the information to set up these devices can be found in the
:doc:`Supported Hardware <hardware_overview>` section of the documentation.
Additional explanations of a few specific sections of the microscope configuration are
below. Notably, the ``zoom`` section of the ``configuration.yaml`` specifies effective
pixel size.

Stage Subsection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The stage section of the microscope 1) puts the stage control from the ``hardware``
section into the microscope 2) sets boundaries for stage movement and 3) optionally
specifies joystick-controlled axes.

.. code-block:: yaml

    microscopes:
        microscope1:
            stage:
                hardware:
                  -
                    name: stage
                    type: ASI
                    serial_number: 123456789
                    axes: [x, y, z, f] # Software
                    axes_mapping: [M, Y, X, Z] # M Shear axis mapping

                  -
                    name: stage
                    type: SyntheticStage
                    serial_number: 987654321
                    axes: [theta]

            joystick_axes: [x, y, z]
            x_max: 100000
            x_min: -100000
            y_max: 100000
            y_min: -100000
            z_max: 100000
            z_min: -100000
            f_max: 100000
            f_min: -100000
            theta_max: 360
            theta_min: 0

            x_offset: 0
            y_offset: 0
            z_offset: 0
            theta_offset: 0
            f_offset: 0

            flip_x: False
            flip_y: False
            flip_z: False
            flip_f: False



First, we set the axes controlled by each piece of hardware and a mapping from the
hardware's API axes to our software's axes. For example, the ASI ``M`` axis is mapped
onto our software's ``X`` axis below.

For ``stages``, **navigate** requires that stages are configured for each microscope
in ``X``, ``Y``, ``Z``, ``F``, and ``Theta``. If no physical stage is present, then
that axes should be defined as a ``SyntheticStage``, as shown above for ``Theta``.

Below this, we specify that only ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` axes may be controlled by a
joystick and we set the stage bounds for each of the axes.

Below this, we set the minimum and maximum values for each axis. This can be used to
set boundaries that prevent the stage from crashing into the sides of a chamber.

Below this, we set the offset for each stage axis. This is an offset relative to other
microscopes (e.g. ``microscope2``) specified in ``configuration.yaml``. In this case,
``microscope1`` is the reference microscope. Additional microscopes may ask the stage
to move to a different offset in order to observe the sample at the same position as
``microscope1``.

Finally, we set the flip flags. These are important for getting
:ref:`multiposition <user_guide/gui_walkthrough:multiposition>` acquisitions to
run properly. We set a convention in the software to expect that increasing value along
an axis brings the sample further into our field of view. That is, increasing the
x-axis position should bring the sample further to the right in the frame (in the case
:ref:`Flip XY <user_guide/gui_walkthrough:LUT>` is toggled on) and increasing the
y-axis position should bring the sample down. Increasing the z-position should bring
the sample closer to the objective. If the stage behaves the opposite of any of these
ways, it is prudent to set the flip flag. If set properly, the calculations for moving
through multiple positions will be performed correctly. These only need to be
configured once when setting up the microscope.

-----------------

Stage Axes Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many times, the coordinate system of the stage hardware do not agree with the optical
definition of each axes identity. For example, many stages define their vertical
dimension as ``Z``, whereas optically, we often define this axis as ``X``. Thus, there
is often a need to map the mechanical axes to the optical axes, and this is done with
the ``axes_mapping`` dictionary entry in the stage hardware section. By default, stage
axes are read in as ``X``, ``Y``, ``Z``, ``Theta``, ``F``, where ``Theta`` is rotation
and ``F`` is focus, but this can be changed by changing axes mapping.

.. code-block:: yaml

    axes: [x, y, z, theta, f]
    axes_mapping: [x, y, z, r, f]

If, on a certain microscope, the ``Z`` stage axis corresponds to the optical Y-axis,
and vice versa, you would then have to import the stages as following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    axes: [x, y, z, theta, f]
    axes_mapping: [x, z, y, r, f]

-----------------

Joystick Axes Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using a joystick, it is possible to disable GUI control of the stage axes
that the joystick can interact with. The axes that the joystick can interact with
appear in the stage field as following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    joystick_axes: [x, y, z]

.. Note::

    These axes should agree with the optical axes. If, on the same microscope
    as mentioned in the :ref:`Stage Axes Definition <user_guide/software_configuration:stage axes definition>`
    section, the joystick were to control the optical y-axis corresponding to
    the stage z axis, you would have to put ``Y`` in the joystick axes brackets
    as following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    joystick_axes: [y]

-----------------

Zoom Subsection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The ``zoom`` section of ``configuration.yaml`` specifies control over microscope
zoom lenses, or devices that change the magnifcation of the imaging system. For
example, we use the `Dynamixel Smart Actuator <https://www.dynamixel.com/>`_ to
control the rotating zoom wheel on an Olympus MVXPLAPO 1x/0.25.

.. code-block:: yaml

    microscopes:
        microscope1:
            zoom:
                hardware:
                    name: zoom
                    type: DynamixelZoom
                    servo_id: 1
                position:
                    0.63x: 0
                    1x: 627
                    2x: 1711
                    3x: 2301
                    4x: 2710
                    5x: 3079
                    6x: 3383
                pixel_size:
                    0.63x: 9.7
                    1x: 6.38
                    2x: 3.14
                    3x: 2.12
                    4x: 1.609
                    5x: 1.255
                    6x: 1.044
                stage_positions:
                    BABB:
                        f:
                            0.63x: 0
                            1x: 1
                            2x: 2
                            3x: 3
                            4x: 4
                            5x: 5
                            6x: 6


The ``positions`` specify the voltage of the actuator at different zoom positions.
The ``pixel_size`` specifies the effective pixel size of the system at each zoom. The
``stage_positions`` account for focal shifts in between the different zoom values
(the MVXPLAPO does not have a consistent focal plane). These may change depending on
the immersion media. Here it is specified for a ``BABB`` (Benzyl Alcohol Benzyl
Benzoate) immersion media.

Regardless of whether or not your microscope uses a zoom device, you must have a
``zoom`` entry, indicating the effective pixel size of your system in micrometers.
For example,

.. code-block:: yaml

    zoom:
      hardware:
        name: zoom
        type: SyntheticZoom
        servo_id: 1
      position:
        N/A: 0
      pixel_size:
        N/A: 0.168


-----------------

.. _experiment_file:

Experiment File
===============

The ``experiment.yml`` file stores information about the current state of the program.
This includes laser and camera parameters, saving options, z-stack settings and much
more. This file does not need to be edited by the user. The program will update it
automatically and save changes automatically on exit.

-----------------

Waveform Constants File
=======================

The ``waveform_constants.yml`` file stores the waveform parameters that can be edited
by going to :menuselection:`Microscope Configuration --> Waveform Parameters`. This
file does not need to be edited by the user. The program will update it automatically
and save changes automatically on exit.

-----------------

Waveform Templates File
=======================

The waveform templates file stores default behavior for the number of repeats for
specific waveforms. This file only needs to be edited if the user wishes to introduce
a new waveform behavior to the application.

-----------------

Rest API Configuration File
===========================

The REST API configuration file specifies where the REST API should look to get
and post data. This is only needed if you are using a plugin that requires the
REST API, such as our communication with `ilastik <https://www.ilastik.org>`_. More
information on how to setup the REST API for communication with ilastik can be found
:doc:`here <case_studies/ilastik_segmentation>`.
