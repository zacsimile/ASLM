Reconfigurable Acquisitions Using Features
==========================================

What are features?
------------------

navigate allows users to reconfigure acquisition routines within the GUI by chaining
so-called "features" together in sequence. A feature is the name given to a single
acquisition unit such as ``Snap``, which snaps an image, or
``MoveToNextPositionInMultiPosition Table``, which moves the stage to the next imaging
position indicated in the multi-position table. Some acquisition units, such as
``Autofocus`` or ``ZStackAcquisition`` have a bit more going on under the hood, but can
be used in the same way.

Customizing Feature Functionality in the GUI
--------------------------------------------

Features can be optionally customized within the GUI. For example instead of
re-programming a feature and loading it again, we can swap Python functions in
and out of features. This can be helpful, e.g., when you are prototyping a function
to automatically detect an object within an image and want to try a few different
options.

Loading Custom Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. You can load customized functions in the software by selecting the menu
   :menuselection:`Features --> Advanced Setting`.

#. In the popup window, choose the feature name with which you want to use the
   dynamic customized functions as feature parameters.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add`, A new line will appear and allow you to edit the parameter
   options. Type the function name which is defined in your python file.

#. Then click :guilabel:`Load` to choose your Oython file.

#. When you run a feature list containing the feature you just set, the new function
   name will appear and you can choose the one you just added.

Custom Feature Lists
====================

The navigate software allows you to chain feature objects into lists to build
acquisition workflows.

Creating a Custom Feature List in the GUI
-----------------------------------------

Once you have loaded your feature list, the next step is to use it in combination with
other features to create an intelligent acquisition workflow. To do this, you will
need to create a new feature list that combines your custom feature with other
features:

#. Select :menuselection:`Features --> Add Customized Feature List`. This will open a
   new dialog box that allows you to create a new feature list.

#. Provide the feature list with a :guilabel:`Feature List Name` of your choice, and
   type the feature list content (which must be a list object). The feature list
   content could be the whole feature list or just a simple feature name. In this
   example, the feature list name is ``Feature Example 2``, and the content is a
   simple feature name:

   .. code-block::

       [{"name": PrepareNextChannel}]

   Once you select `Preview`, the feature list will be displayed in the
   :guilabel:`Preview` window. If you are satisfied with the feature list, select
   `OK` to save it.

#. You can edit the list of features directly by modifying the text, or through a
   popup menu that is available by right clicking the feature tile. The popup menu
   allows you to add a new feature, delete a feature, or edit a feature. In this
   example, click :guilabel:`Insert After`, and a new feature ``PrepareNextChannel``
   will be inserted by default.


   .. image:: images/step_4.png


   .. image:: images/step_5.png


#. To change the identity of the inserted feature, you can select a different feature
   form the drop-down menu. For example, the feature can be changed from
   ``PrepareNextChannel`` to ``LoopByCount``. The parameters of the feature can be
   changed automatically in the popup window.

#. If you click the preview button, a graphical representation of the feature list will
   be displayed.

6. If you want a loop structure, type a pair of parentheses around the features, then
   click :guilabel:`Preview`. Given this design, you can loop through arbitrary
   features in a user-selected format.

#. After editing the feature list, click :guilabel:`Add`. The new feature list will
   show up under the :guilabel:`Features` menu.

Editing Feature Lists on the Fly
--------------------------------

#. Select the feature list you want to run, choose "Customized" acquisition mode, and
   then click :guilabel:`Acquire`. A feature edit popup window will show up. In this
   popup window, you can see the structure of the selected feature list.


   .. image:: images/step_16.png

   .. image:: images/step_18.png


#. Click one feature in the preview window, a parameter window will show up. Then you
   could set the parameter you want. Close the parameter window.


   .. image:: images/step_19.png


#. Click “Confirm”. The feature list will start to run.

Deleting Feature Lists
----------------------

#. Select the feature list you want to delete in the :guilabel:`Features` menu.
#. Then, navigate back to the :guilabel:`Features` menu and select
   :guilabel:`Delete Selected Feature` The feature list will be removed from the menu
   and the software.
