=============
Filter Wheels
=============

Filter wheels can be used in both illumination and detection paths. The user
is expected to change the names of available filters to match what is in the
filter wheel or turret. If more than one filter wheel is present, the user
should add additional filter_wheel instances in the ``configuration.yaml``
file as follows:

.. collapse:: Configuration File

    .. code-block:: yaml

      microscopes:
        microscope_name:
          -
            filter_wheel:
              hardware:
                name: Lower Filter Wheel
                type: SutterFilterWheel
                wheel_number: 1
                port: COM1
                baudrate: 9600
              filter_wheel_delay: 0.03
              available_filters:
                Empty-Alignment: 0
                GFP: 1
                RFP: 2
                Far-Red: 3
          -
            filter_wheel:
              hardware:
                name: Upper Filter Wheel
                type: SutterFilterWheel
                wheel_number: 2
                port: COM1
                baudrate: 9600
              filter_wheel_delay: 0.03
              available_filters:
                CFP: 0
                YFP: 1
                RFP: 2
                Far-Red: 3

.. note::

    The `name` parameter under `hardware` is optional. If not provided, the name of the
    device will be default to Filter 0, Filter 1, ... Filter N in the GUI. However, if
    is is provided, then the GUI will automatically use the name provided as a label.

Sutter Instruments
------------------

Lambda 10-3 & 10-B
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We typically communicate with Sutter Lambda 10-3 controllers via serial port. It is
recommended that you first establish communication with the device using manufacturer
provided software. Alternatively, one can use MicroManager. For some filter wheel types,
the filter_wheel_delay is calculated according to the size of the move and model of the
filter wheel. For other filter wheel types, the filter_wheel_delay is a fixed value, which is specified as
the ``filter_wheel_delay`` entry in the configuration file. The number of filter wheels
connected to the controller is specified as ``wheel_number`` in the configuration file.
Currently, both wheels are moved to the same position, but future implementations will
enable control of both filter wheels independently.

FW-1000
~~~~~~~

The ASI `filter wheel <https://www.asiimaging
.com/illumination-control/fw-1000-high-speed-filter-wheel/>`_ is controlled by the
ASI Tiger Controller. Thus, you should provide the same ``comport`` entry as you did
for the stage. A single communication instance is used for both the stage and filter wheel.

.. note::
    Currently, the software only supports a single filter wheel for the MAC6000
    device. Should additional filter wheels be necessary, please reach out to the
    **navigate** team by placing a feature request on GitHub.

Analog/Digital Devices
----------------------

Some manufacturers provide filter wheels that are controlled by analog or digital signals.
Here, each digital signal corresponds to a filter position. The user must specify the
number of filters in the filter wheel and the digital signal that corresponds to each
filter position.

Synthetic Filter Wheel
----------------------
If no filter wheel is present, one must configure the software to use a synthetic
filter wheel.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      microscopes:
        microscope_name:
            filter_wheel:
              hardware:

                wheel_number: 1
                port: COM1

              filter_wheel_delay: 0.03
              available_filters:
