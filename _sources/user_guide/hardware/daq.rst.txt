Data Acquisition Cards
======================

Data acquisition cards deliver and receive analog and digital signals.
To acquire an image, the software calculates all of the analog and digital waveforms and
queues these waveforms on the data acquisition card. Upon receipt of a trigger (either from the software itself,
or an external piece of hardware), all
of the analog and digital signals are delivered in parallel. This provides
deterministic behavior on a per-frame basis, which is necessary for proper acquisition of light-sheet data.
It does not however provide us with deterministic behavior between image
frames, and some jitter in timing is anticipated.

National Instruments (NI)
-------------------------
In principle, most NI-based data acquisition cards should work with the software, so long
as there are a sufficient number of analog and digital ports, and the sampling rate (typically 100 kHz)
is high enough per port.

Prior to installing the card within
the computer, first install the `NI-DAQmx drivers <https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html>`_.
Once installed, connect the PCIe or PXIe-based device to the computer. A functioning
system should be recognized by the operating system, and visible in the Windows Device
Manager as a **NI Data Acquisition Device**.

.. note::

    **navigate** has been tested with the following versions of the NI-DAQmx drivers:

    - 22.5.0
    - 22.8.0
    - 23.3.0
    - 23.8.0


.. tip::

    **The most important aspect is to wire up the breakout box properly.**

    To find the device pin outs for your NI-based data acquisition card, open NI
    MAX, find the card under devices, right-click and select "device pinouts".

    Important: Should you use the SCB-68A breakout box, do not look at the pinout on
    the back of the cover. This is misleading. You must look at the device pinouts in
    NI MAX.


.. note::

    For NI-based cards, ``port0/line1`` is the equivalent of ``P0.1``.
    There are multiple pins for each PFIO, including source, out, gate, etc. You must
    use the out terminal.


- Identify the device name in NI MAX, and change it if you would like. Common names are
  ``Dev1``, ``Dev2``, etc. This name must correspond with the pinouts provided in the
  configuration file.

- Connect the ``master_trigger_out_line`` to the ``trigger_source`` with a direct wire,
  commonly ``PXI6259/port0/line1`` and ``/PXI6259/PFI0``. In this example, the default name
  for the device (e.g., ``Dev1``) has been changed to ``PXI6259``.

- Connect the ``camera_trigger_out_line`` to the ``Ext. Trigger`` on the camera using
  the ``CTR0Out`` pin.

- These values must precisely match those in the configuration file. An example is provided below:

**navigate** has been tested with the following NI-based cards:

PCIe/PXIe-6738
"""""""""""""""

The PCIe-6738 can only create one software-timed analog task for every four channels.
As such, the lasers much be attached to analog output ports outside of the banks (shown as solid lines in the device pinout) used
by the galvo/remote focus units. For example, if you use ao0, ao2, and ao6 for the
remote focus, galvo, and galvo stage, the lasers should be connected to ao8, ao9, and
ao10. In such a configuration, they will not compete with the other analog output
ports. Since only one task will be created created on the ao8, ao9, ao10 bank at a time
(only one laser is on at a time), only one laser can be on at a time. If we wanted to
turn lasers on simultaneously, we could distribute the lasers across independent banks
(e.g. ao8, ao14, ao19).

------------------


PCIe/PXIe-6259
"""""""""""""""

The PXI-6259 can create one software-timed analog task per channel. As such, the
galvo/remote focus/lasers can be attached to any of the analog output ports. The 6259 has
two connectors, and it is important to make sure that the analog and digital ports that you
are using are connected to the correct connector. For example, if you are using ``ao0``, this is
located on ``connector 0``.

PCIe/PXIe-6723
"""""""""""""""

The PXI-6723 can also create one software-timed analog task per channel. As such, the analog
outputs can be wired up as is most convenient.

Synthetic Data Acquisition Card
-------------------------------
If no data acquisition card is present, one must configure the software to use a synthetic
data acquisition card.
