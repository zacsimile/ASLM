<h1>Case Study: Setting up the an Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscope<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-setting-up-the-an-axially-swept-light-sheet-microscope" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The key to properly setting up the navigate software is to sequentially enable select
devices, and troubleshoot each one independently. By carefully and methodically
adding devices, and checking that they are functional, one can be confident that the
entire system is working as intended. In this example, we will be using a Hamamatsu
Flash 4.0 camera. However, you may also use another Hamamatsu SCMOS model, or a
Photometrics camera, as long as the drivers are installed and the camera is
recognized by the computer. The microscope will operate in a sample scanning format
for volumetric image acquisition.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Launch the software in synthetic hardware mode. This requires that the conda
environment has been established, and that the software has been installed. Once the
conda environment has been activated, the software can be launched by typing
<cite>navigate -sh</cite> in the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the software has been launched, the GUI will appear. Open the folder
containing the configuration files by selecting to the menu <span class="menuselection">File ‣
Open Configuration Files</span>. This will open the <cite>.navigate</cite> folder in the file
explorer, which is where local configuration files are stored.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <cite>configuration.yaml</cite> file in your preferred integrated development
environment (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>For every device in the <cite>hardware</cite> and <cite>microscopes</cite> sections of the <cite>configuration
.yaml</cite> file, you will need to change the type to <cite>synthetic</cite>. For convenience, we
provide a <cite>synthetic_configuration.yaml</cite> file that can be used to replace the
<cite>configuration.yaml</cite> file that already has synthetic for each device. You will need
to replace the <cite>configuration.yaml</cite> file that is located in the <cite>.navigate</cite> folder with
the <cite>synthetic_configuration.yaml</cite> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the software, but this time launch it in a standard operating mode by
typing <cite>navigate</cite> in the terminal. This confirms that the base configuration file is
functional. If any problems are encountered, please submit a ticket on GitHub under
the issues tab.</p></li>
<li><p>We will now begin sequentially adding non-synthetic devices to the configuration
file. The first device to add is the data acquisition card. Of course, the data
acquisition card’s drivers must be <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#494676">installed</a> and functioning.
To confirm that it is functioning, it is best to use the <cite>NI MAX</cite> software and
evaluate the card’s functionality with an oscilloscope.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <cite>hardware</cite> and <cite>microscopes</cite> sections of the <cite>configuration.yaml</cite> file, change
the <cite>type</cite> to <cite>NI</cite>. You will also need to hard-wire the master_trigger_out_line to the
trigger_source. The identity of these pins can be found in the NI MAX software by right-
clicking on the device and selecting <span class="guilabel">Device Pinouts</span>. You will also need to make
sure that the identity of the pinouts is correct in the <cite>configuration.yaml</cite> file.
Most commonly, NI cards default to a device name such as “Dev1”. You can change this
name in NI MAX, or leave it as is, but whatever you do it has to match the name in
the <cite>configuration.yaml</cite> file (e.g., <cite>PXI6259/port0/line1`</cite> if the name of the device is
“PXI6259” and the pinout is “port0/line1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <cite>navigate</cite> software in the standard operating mode, select the “Continuous Scan”
mode, and press <span class="guilabel">Acquire</span>. If the software is operating as expected, it should display
a synthetically generated image of noise. If it does not, double-check the configuration
file and make sure that the <cite>master_trigger_out_line</cite> is connected to the <cite>trigger_source</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, we will add the camera. The camera must be connected to the computer via a USB
or the dedicated frame-grabber cable. The camera drivers must also be installed. The
camera drivers can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="https://dcam-api.com">DCAM-API Website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the camera type to <cite>HamamatsuOrca</cite> and input the correct serial number,
which can be found on the camera label or through the DCAMConfigurator or HCImage.
You will also need to connect the <cite>camera_trigger_out_line</cite> on the data acquisition
card to the BNC port labeled “Ext. Trig.” on the back of the camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the software and begin an acquisition in the “Continuous Scan” mode. The camera
should not be delivering frames to the software.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the Filter Wheel. First, identify the comport via the device manager
on Windows. Change the <cite>filter_wheel</cite> type to <cite>SutterFilterWheel</cite> or equivalent in
the <cite>hardware</cite> and <cite>microscopes</cite> sections of the configuration file, and
provide the necessary information for that filter wheel device (e.g., <cite>baudrate`</cite>). At
this point, you can also name each filter if desired under the <cite>available_filters</cite>
section.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the software and select multiple channels in the channel settings tab,
each with different filters. Run the software in “Continuous Scan” mode again and ensure
that the filter wheel is changing filters between each acquisition.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the lasers. Ideally, the lasers will operate in a mixed modulation mode,
which requires that the NI card provides both analog and digital signals to each
laser. This allows blanking of the laser, as well as control of its intensity. Open
the control software for the lasers, and configure them in a mixed modulation mode.
Next, connect the analog output of the NI card to the analog input of the laser.
Finally, connect the digital output of the NI card to the digital input of the laser.
A common port for the analog and digital outputs are <cite>PXI6733/ao0</cite> and
<cite>PXI6733/port0/line2</cite>, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the lasers in the <cite>hardware</cite> and <cite>microscopes</cite> sections of the
configuration to type <cite>NI</cite>. Here you can specify the wavelength of each laser, as
well as the minimium and maximum volts to deliver to the laser in both the analog
(<cite>power</cite>) and digital (<cite>onoff</cite>) sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure the Voice Coil. Most voice coils only require an analog signal to
control, which can be delivered via the type <cite>NI</cite> in the <cite>hardware</cite> and <cite>microscopes</cite>.
However, some voice coils must be configured to accept an analog signal upon each
power cycle (e.g., <cite>EquipmentSolutions</cite>). In this case, you will also need to specify
the COM port.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the galvos. Galvos can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including
shadow reduction, digitally scanned light-sheet formation, and also for stepping the
beam in z during the acquisition of a z-stack. If the galvo will be used for a
z-stack, it should be configured in the <cite>stage</cite> section. All other galvos are placed
in <cite>galvo</cite> section. For a sample-scanning ASLM, we use a resonant galvo to perform
shadow reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>Install and configure the Stages. You will need to specify stages for x, y, z,
theta, and f. If you do not need one of these stages, it should remain specified as a
<cite>SyntheticStage</cite>. It is also important to make sure that you map the stage
coordinates to the software coordinates. For example, with the Sutter MP285, the
vertical movement of the stage is its z axis. However, for light-sheet microscopes
that are laid out horizontally, this axis is the x axis. Thus, we must map the
hardware z-axis to the software x-axis. This is done with the <cite>axes</cite> and
<cite>axes_mapping</cite> entries, which for the example provided, would be as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">axes</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">x</span><span class="p p-Indicator">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1"># software axes</span>
<span class="nt">axes_mapping</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">z</span><span class="p p-Indicator">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">#hardware axes</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Importantly, any stage you designate as z will be used for acquisition of a z-stack.</p>
</li>
